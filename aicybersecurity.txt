AI Cybersecurity
-----------------------------

The cybersecurity arena faces significant challenges in the form of larges scale hacking attacks of
 different types which harm organizations of all kinds and create billions of dollars in business 
damage. Artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has begun to be used by 
security companies - for example SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions. 
The more advanced of these solutions use AI and NLP to automatically sort the data in networks 
into high risk and low risk information. This enables security teams to focus on the attacks 
that have the potential to do real harm to the organization, and not become victims of 
attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Malware and others.
