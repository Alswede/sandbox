Artificial intelligence arms race
------------------------------------

The main military applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are to enhance C2, 
Communications, Sensors, Integration and Interoperability. Artificial Intelligence technologies 
enables coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of 
enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Join Fires 
between networked combat vehicles and tanks also inside Manned and Unmanned Teams (MUM-T).

Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion 
in 2015.[318][319] Military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful
asset. Many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military 
applications of AI.

In 2014, former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel posited the "Third Offset Strategy" that rapid 
advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare.According to data
science and analytics firm Govini, The U.S. Department of Defense increased investment in 
artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing from $5.6 billion in 2011 to $7.4 billion in
2016.However, the civilian NSF budget for AI saw no increase in 2017.

The U.S. has many military AI combat programs, such as the Sea Hunter autonomous warship,
which is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member, and to even
guide itself in and out of port. As of 2017, a temporary US Department of Defense directive
requires a human operator to be kept in the loop when it comes to the taking of human life by 
autonomous weapons systems. Japan Times reported in 2018 that the United States private 
investment is around $70 billion per year.
